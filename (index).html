    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small"> Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
        The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
        Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
        legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
        education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
        responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
        states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
        policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast.</p>

    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small"> the seventh-largest country in the world, with a total area of 3,287,263 square kilometres (1,269,219 sq
        mi).[8] India measures 3,214 km (1,997 mi) from north to south and 2,933 km (1,822 mi) from east to
        west. It has a land frontier of 15,200 km (9,445 mi) and a coastline of 7,517 km (4,671 mi).


        The formation of the Himalayas (pictured) during the Early Eocene some 52 mya was a key factor in
        determining India's modern-day climate; global climate and ocean chemistry may have been impacted
        too.[9]
        The Indian plate and Eurasia collided between 40 and 60 million years ago according to four
        observations, one being that there is no mammalian fossil record in India from around 50 million years
        ago.[10] On its way, the Indian plate passed over the Reunion hotspot which led to volcanic activity,
        thus forming the Deccan Traps.

    <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small"> The history of agriculture in India dates back to the Indus Valley
        Civilization. India ranks second worldwide in farm outputs. As per 2018, agriculture employed more than
        50% of the Indian work force and contributed 17â€“18% to country's GDP.[1]

        In 2016, agriculture and allied sectors like animal husbandry, forestry and fisheries accounted for
        15.4% of the GDP (gross domestic product) with about 41.49% of the workforce in 2020.[2][3][4][5] India
        ranks first in the world with highest net cropped area followed by US and China.[6] The economic
        contribution of agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining with the country's broad-based economic
        growth. Still, agriculture is demographically the broadest economic sector and plays a significant role
        in the overall socio-economic fabric of India.</p>
